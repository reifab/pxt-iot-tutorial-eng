# Tutorial: Queue Sensor System for the IoT Cube

## Important notes before you start
* Enlarge the window: Make this browser window or the MakeCode window larger so you can see everything well.
* Do not forget to scroll: Always scroll all the way down to see every step. Otherwise you will miss parts of the tutorial.
* Click on links: If you see blue underlined text (a link), click it. The tutorial continues there or additional content opens.

## 📗 Introduction

Imagine you want to automatically find out how many people are waiting in front of a smart toilet. In this project you build a nine-channel light barrier 💡👁️ that uses simple technology: an RGB LED strip 💡 and a light sensor 👁️.

* Prerequisites: 🌱 IoT Basics completed and queue without sensors implemented (only with buttons A and B), see tutorials here: [Queue without sensors](https://makecode.microbit.org/#tutorial:github:fave-smartfeld/pxt-smart-toilet-tutorial/docs/tutorials/warteschlange)

* Difficulty: 🔥🔥🔥🔥

In this tutorial you build a program step by step that counts the waiting people (Duplo figures) and sends the captured data to the internet via 🛜 LoRa.

The tutorial is split into two parts. In the first part you focus on the sensor system, in the second part you send the number of people to the internet:

* [Part 1 - still without internet connection](https://makecode.microbit.org/#tutorial:github:reifab/pxt-iot-tutorial-eng/docs/tutorials/warteschlange-sensorik-part-1)
* [Part 2 - with internet connection](https://makecode.microbit.org/#tutorial:github:reifab/pxt-iot-tutorial-eng/docs/tutorials/warteschlange-sensorik-part-2)

Tip: In each step, scroll all the way down and only then click the next button so you do not miss anything.
