## Introduction
Prerequisites: 🌱 IoT Basics completed
Difficulty: 🔥🔥⚪⚪

In this tutorial you build a program step by step that simulates the soap level and sends the data to the internet via 🛜 LoRa.

The tutorial is split into three parts:

* [Part 1 - still without internet connection](https://makecode.microbit.org/#tutorial:github:reifab/pxt-iot-tutorial-eng/docs/tutorials/seifenspender-part-1)  
* [Part 2 - with internet connection](https://makecode.microbit.org/#tutorial:github:reifab/pxt-iot-tutorial-eng/docs/tutorials/seifenspender-part-2)
* [Part 3 - with internet connection and sensors](https://makecode.microbit.org/#tutorial:github:reifab/pxt-iot-tutorial-eng/docs/tutorials/seifenspender-part-3)

Tip: In each step, scroll all the way down and only then click the next button so you do not miss anything.
